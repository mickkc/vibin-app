# Vibin' App

This is the client application for [Vibin'](https://github.com/mickkc/vibin), a self-hosted music streaming service.

Please note that this project, just like the server, is still in its early stages of development and not yet usable for production.

> [!NOTE]
> This is my first Flutter / Dart project, I am still learning the framework and the language.
